#How to install:

#The first step to set this is to verify that you can handle virtualization in your machine.
#To check this run this command:

cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep dmx

#Then, check your kvm with:

ls mod | grep kvm

#If it doesn't print kvm_yourcpu try doing this:

modprobe kvm


#After this setup you can run the first script to setup the VM. 

Proyecto.sh

#Then, choose one of the virtual machines to install: ftp, db or apache.
#When you run that script, open the folder of the machine that you choose.
#You will find other script there to set up the extra services for your VM.
